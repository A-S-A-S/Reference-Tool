# REF/FLOW: Image Reference Tool

Tool designed to streamline gesture drawing practice by providing quick access to visual references. It does two things I want it to do:
1. **Download Images**: Automatically downloads all images from a specified Pinterest board to a local folder.
2. **Image Display**: Displays images from a specified local folder in a random order at a custom interval, perfect for timed drawing sessions.

## Installation

**Quick Start**: To get started immediately, just run `quickstart.bat`.

## TODO

- Make the downloading process asynchronous
- Consider content extension on downloading 
- Optimize download for large boards
